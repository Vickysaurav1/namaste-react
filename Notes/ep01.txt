we can use recat via CDN to create react app in our project.
React CDN can be included by going to react offical website and copy the cdn link and paste it in the html file.
once CDN link is copied, the strcture can be written as:

index.html
<html>
<body>
<div id="root"></div>
<!-- Add this script tag -->
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

App.js

const head = React.createElement("h1", {}, "This is react using CDN");
const root = ReactDom.cretaeRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(head);
