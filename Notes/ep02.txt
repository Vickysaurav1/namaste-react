igniting the react app

we use package.json file which holds all the npm.
1st step:-
terminal>npm init> enter> write description> version> enter > enter > enter.

this creates the package.json file.

where we can write the dev-dependency and other dependency as well.
production ready code optimizer tool - parcel, webpack and etc...
we are using parcel because this is awesome and it has some extra feature than webpack.

in package.json file tiddle (~) and carret (^) comes along with the dependency version.
they both have their own significance.

^ allows version of dependency to auto update itself for minor upgrades.

package-lock.json => package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
put node_modules in .gitignore files so that it can not go to git while pushing code.
